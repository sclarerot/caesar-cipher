# caesar-cipher

This is another practice thingy from the Odin Project. This one's for Ruby. Writing code that encrypts a given string with the Caesar cipher method.

It is a fully functional program which takes an input string and converts it to a Caesar cipher for the user, so it's not just a simple method, it's an actual command line program that encrypts a string for the user.
